# Weather

The weather page is an application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. 
My primary objective is to empower users with the tools they need to effectively plan their activities, stay informed about current weather conditions, and make informed decisions based on accurate and reliable weather predictions.

## Features

The website is a Weather App. Visitors can check the weather in any city or any countries. The landing page provides an overview of all the content on the site for the visitor. The landing page provides the weather search button and a default photo representing weather types so that the user has a clear knowledge of what this site is and how to use it.

* Input field 
The input field is easy to use, quick and accessible. The page only instruction is provided by the input field :

* Search button ( magnifying glass)
 The search buttons have a hover effect  when you move your mouse over the button turns blue. When you click the magnifying glass the page loads your search result if typed something (correct) if not a "Weather data not found" message will appear. The input field responds to enter as well, in the same way as clicked on the magnifying glass. 

 ### API`s
