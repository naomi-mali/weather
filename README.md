# Weather

The weather page is an application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. 
My primary objective is to empower users with the tools they need to effectively plan their activities, stay informed about current weather conditions, and make informed decisions based on accurate and reliable weather predictions.

## Features

The website is a Weather App. Visitors can check the weather in any city or any countries. The landing page provides an overview of all the content on the site for the visitor. The landing page provides the weather search button and a default photo representing weather types so that the user has a clear knowledge of what this site is and how to use it.

* Input field 
The input field is easy to use, quick and accessible. The page only instruction is provided by the input field :

![Weather (7)](https://github.com/naomi-mali/images-in-readme.md/assets/148251951/048cbf4f-842c-4fa1-a6ba-2f2d80e78453)

* Search button ( magnifying glass) ![naomi-mali_weather](https://github.com/naomi-mali/images-in-readme.md/assets/148251951/7f2b43fe-8810-494e-9804-95c42f057e71)

 The search buttons have a hover effect  when you move your mouse over the button turns blue. When you click the magnifying glass the page loads your search result if typed something (correct) if not a "Weather data not found" message will appear. The input field responds to enter as well, in the same way as clicked on the magnifying glass. 

 ### API`s 
 * [Geographic API](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=applied-oxygen-415923)
The input field has a geographic location API so that when you search a location it will give suggestions in a drop down menu with more specific location details like: region, county, country, continent.

![Weather (9)](https://github.com/naomi-mali/images-in-readme.md/assets/148251951/d7402480-9cbb-425b-a1c5-89ad7c16c5ff)

* [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) 
The Weather API allows you to access current weather data for any location on Earth. The weather data comes from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations. All the images are coordinated to the weather and daytime, and they are changing in accord with the actual weather type of the location.

* Future Implementations:
Along with the prediction of current weather conditions, I would also want to offer important  weather forecasting app users with stunning maps which would allow the user to explore weather conditions in the past and the future.
